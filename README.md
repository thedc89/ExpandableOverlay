# Expandable Overlay

### About

This is an exemplary project to show you how expandable player overlays, as seen in apps like Spotify, Apple Podcast or Overcast, might be created.

I used SnapKit to avoid hassle with playing with constraints programmatically. I have also decided not to use storyboards to keep all the layout code in one place.

The app architecture relies on coordinators pattern and container view controllers - thanks [Matteo Manferdini](https://matteomanferdini.com) for inspiration.

### Installation

Just download the source code and run it.
